            Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document
            called “Information Management: A Proposal”. Believe it or not,
            Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his
            boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting”
            on the cover.

            Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the
            foundation of today`s web (and which you may have seen appear on
            parts of your web browser):
            <ul type="square">
                <li><strong> HTML:</strong> HyperText Markup Language. The
                    markup (formatting) language for the web. </li>
            <li><strong>URI:</strong> Uniform Resource
                Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify
                to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP:</strong>
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked
                resources from across the web.</li></ul>
